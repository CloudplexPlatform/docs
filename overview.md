# Overview

Welcome to CloudPlex.  

We at CloudPlex are one of the earliest and most experienced users of Kubernetes and have been developing applications using Kubernetes for over five years. As early as mid-2014, we were working with the team at Google which created and launched the first Kubernetes release. We have gone through all the trials and tribulations of working with the complexity of Kubernetes, and we understand your pain. 

We know that, building, deploying and managing an application with disparate technologies places an enormous burden on developers to learn and maintain complex systems. Therefore, our goal is to get you to rapidly build, debug and deploy Kubernetes applications with minimal effort, and without the blood, sweat and tears that come with the manual use of Kubernetes. As you may have already discovered, Kubernetes is burdensome to use, and hard to master. 

CloudPlex have developed a platform for the cloud native applications. CloudPlex is an enterprise-ready platform, with all the key features needed to run mission-critical applications in production. A platform using which different types of applications can be created and deployment can be performed. Multiple cloud native tools has been integrated with the platform and user can set them up easily in CloudPlex. This saves user from the hassle of understanding and configuring different tools, as all this can be managed using CloudPlex's intuitive unified user interface.

CloudPlex can effectively connect, manage and secure microservices and also supports function as a service or serverless. It is a complete cloud management platform which not only provides configured cloud tools and technologies at one place but also provides monitoring, dashboards, audits and financial as well. It provides complete and detailed solutions for everything related to cloud.

As you continue with your Kubernetes journey, our experienced team is here to assist you to become productive quickly and to help you build your application with the least amount of friction. We offer free use of our platform to developers, hands-on labs, access to a community of Kubernetes developers, and email support to help you achieve your goal and to overcome any obstacles along the way.
