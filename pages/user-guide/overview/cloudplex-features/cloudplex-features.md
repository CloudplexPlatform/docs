# CloudPlex Features

CloudPlex Ultramesh is full of advanced features, some of the major ones are listed below.

### Assessment & Evaluation

Users can also run tests on the new services or the new version of services before taking those services live into production. This can even be done without affecting the existing users. Using this feature, you can check the health and telemetry of services before going live. 

### CI/CD Integration

Ultramesh also provides easy integration with all the major CI/CD tools. You can integrate that without even disrupting your existing development, testing and deployment processes. 

### Dynamic Variables

Ultramesh provides the feature of dynamic variables for parameter passing. You dont need to hard code anything in the applications. Dynamic variables can be stored in the platform and passed to the services and applications on deployment or execution. All types of variables can be stored e.g. IDs, passwords, endpoints, namespace etc. 

### Integration with Legacy Applications

Ultramesh intuitive UI also provides fully automated integration of legacy applications. Using simple steps you can fully automate and integrate your legacy applications with the platform and make them part of your mesh. 

You can deploy agents remotely on legacy application VM and establish remote connectivity by using minimal user intervention. 

### Monitoring & Alerts

For timely monitoring and issue diagnosis, you can setup alerts as well in Ultramesh. Alerts can be setup for monitoring of different mesh components like CPU, Memory, usage and latency.  Threshold can be set on which the platform which generate alerts. 

Alerts notifications can be configured using webhooks for different collaboration platforms like slack etc. 

Using monitoring and alerts, you can keep a timely check on the behavior and activity pattern of different components in a mesh. 

### Multiple Cloud Support

Ultramesh supports different clouds and all the tools to make the process of deployment efficient and hassle free. It also provides support for multiple Kubernetes Cluster across multiple clouds.

### Reusable Templates

Ultramesh architecture supports reusable templates. Users can benefit from the templates optimized and configured by the security and network experts by using it for their mesh or applications. 

Developers can focus on their other core tasks and let experts take care of their security and networks settings by providing reusable templates. 

### Service Flow Diagram

Ultramesh interactive drag and drop UI provides service flow diagram. This decreases the process of understanding the whole flow of services deployment. 

Ultramesh provide a flow diagram using which user can easily visualize whole process of what will happen with service mesh. Using this user can at once understand which components  are communicating with which other components and any issue arrived at any point can be taken care of in no time. Real time flow of services can also be be visualized. 

### Service Mesh

In Ultramesh, you can stitch together hybrid applications containing multiple microservices, serverless functions, managed services and APIs. 

Platform Mesh Designer provides:

1. For serverless, when you commit the code into the code repo, pulls the code, builds it, creates a transient container and execute on-demand.
2. Library of open source and commercially available microservices.

### Tools Integration

Ultramesh has integrated multiple cloud native tools with the platform. Instead of manually downloading and configuring each tool separately, user can setup up the whole thing in Ultramesh in one go and get everything up and running in under **30 minutes**. Some of the major cloud native tools integrated with Ultramesh are - Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, Knative, Grafana, Prometheus, Kiali.

### Unified User Interface

Ultramesh is basically a deployment platform using which you can manage, develop and deploy cloud native applications. It usually takes weeks or even months to understand and use different cloud native tools. 

Using Ultramesh Unified UI, you can not only manage and configure different cloud native technologies like Istio, Knative etc at one place but also develop and deploy applications as well. Mege Mesh also provides interactive visual drag and drop experience to make things easy for the users. Also instead of learning all the complex cloud native tools user can just setup an account on Ultramesh and leave the rest to us. 

Keeping in mind automation and future support as well, Ultramesh also provides API support as well for all the features available in platform.
