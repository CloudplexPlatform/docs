### Dynamic Variables

CloudPlex provides the feature of dynamic variables for parameter passing. You dont need to hard code anything in the applications. Dynamic variables can be stored in the platform and passed to the services and applications on deployment or execution. All types of variables can be stored e.g. IDs, passwords, endpoints, namespace etc.

### Integration with Legacy Applications

CloudPlex intuitive UI also provides fully automated integration of legacy applications. Using simple steps you can fully automate and integrate your legacy applications with the platform and make them part of your application. 

You can deploy agents remotely on legacy application VM and establish remote connectivity by using minimal user intervention.

### Monitoring & Alerts

For timely monitoring and issue diagnosis, you can setup alerts as well in CloudPlex. Alerts can be setup for monitoring of different app components like CPU, Memory, usage and latency.  Threshold can be set on which the platform which generate alerts. 

Alerts notifications can be configured using webhooks for different collaboration platforms like slack etc. 

Using monitoring and alerts, you can keep a timely check on the behavior and activity pattern of different components in a app.

### Reusable Templates

CloudPlex architecture supports reusable templates. Users can benefit from the templates optimized and configured by the security and network experts by using it for their applications. 

Developers can focus on their other core tasks and let experts take care of their security and networks settings by providing reusable templates. 

### Service Flow Diagram

CloudPlex interactive drag and drop UI provides service flow diagram. This decreases the process of understanding the whole flow of services deployment. 

CloudPlex provide a flow diagram using which user can easily visualize whole process of what will happen with service application. Using this user can at once understand which components  are communicating with which other components and any issue arrived at any point can be taken care of in no time. Real time flow of services can also be be visualized.

### Service Application

In CloudPlex, you can stitch together hybrid applications containing multiple microservices, serverless functions, managed services and APIs. 

Platform App Designer provides:

1. For serverless, when you commit the code into the code repo, pulls the code, builds it, creates a transient container and execute on-demand.
2. Library of open source and commercially available microservices.

### Tools Integration

CloudPlex has integrated multiple cloud native tools with the platform. Instead of manually downloading and configuring each tool separately, user can setup up the whole thing in CloudPlex in one go and get everything up and running in under **30 minutes**. Some of the major cloud native tools integrated with CloudPlex are - Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, Knative, Grafana, Prometheus, Kiali.
