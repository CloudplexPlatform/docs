# What is CloudPlex

CloudPlex helps developers easily build, deploy and manage a unified service applications for any level of deployment, from microservices to legacy. It helps in deployment and management of cloud-native applications with microservices and serverless using a single unified view. 

CloudPlex is not just restricted to microservices. In order to meet the requirements of real-life applications developers can easily extend their applications to seamlessly include serverless functions, legacy applications, cloud provider managed services, and third-party APIs, with microservices.

CloudPlex is also a comprehensive Cloud Management and orchestration platform, which an Enterprise can use to conveniently migrate its applications and services to any public cloud including AWS, Azure, GCP etc. It also supports private as well as hybrid clouds. Using CloudPlex, you can effectively manage complex cloud environments to meet your business needs.

CloudPlex provides an easy to use, intuitive, drag and drop studio to design and configure the apps. Complex tasks like traffic management, designing of circuit breakers and injection of faults for chaos testing can be performed visually. You can create an app, fully integrated with CI/CD pipeline, from scratch in a matter of minutes without installing or configuring complex technologies like Istio, KNative, Prometheus, Grafana etc. Just design your application through Software as a Service (SaaS) and let CloudPlex take care of configuration of cloud native tools. 

CloudPlex also provides Dynamic configurations for the apps as well. Instead of hardcoding the configuration parameters, user can configure the apps visually using dynamic parameters. Dynamic Configuration generates service parameters, such as pod IP, endpoints, credentials and runtime parameters of services, which are resolved at run-time through dynamic binding.

You may have experienced that at the core of Kubernetes complexity lies YAML. Every application requires hand cranking a large number of YAML manifest and config files, which is a tedious, complex and error prone process.  We have created an intuitive visual drag and drop interface to eliminate the need for you to manually create YAML manifest and config files. 

One of the key difficulties of using Kubernetes is that it is very big and comprehensive and a very large number of touch points, but you will only need some of these features when you start building your application. With CloudPex, we do not overwhelm you with all these options. The platform provides all the default values and allows you to build your application with minimal configuration. 

We created this platform to address all the pain points that you experience when developing with Kubernetes.  Below we describe some of the key pain points which you are experiencing  or may encounter during your Kubernetes journey, and how the CloudPlex platform simplifies building your Kubernetes application.

CloudPlex offers numerous features like Application Provisioning and Orchestration, Security & Identity Management, Automation, Team and Role Based Access Control, Policy Based Security, Financial Controls, Multi Tenancy, Support for Slack Based Team Collaboration, Multicluster Federation, Support for Hybrid Cloud and many more as explained below.
