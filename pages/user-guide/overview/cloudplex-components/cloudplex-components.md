Mega Mesh is full of advanced features, some of the major ones are listed below.

### Tools Integration

Mega Mesh has integrated multiple cloud native tools with the platform. Instead of manually downloading and configuring each tool separately, user can setup up the whole thing in Mega Mesh in one go and get everything up and running in under **30 minutes**. Some of the major cloud native tools integrated with Mega Mesh are - Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, Knative, Grafana, Prometheus, Kiali.

### Unified User Interface

Mega Mesh is basically a deployment platform using which you can manage, develop and deploy cloud native applications. It usually takes weeks or even months to understand and use different cloud native tools. 

Using Mega Mesh Unified UI, you can not only manage and configure different cloud native technologies like Istio, Knative etc at one place but also develop and deploy applications as well. Mege Mesh also provides interactive visual drag and drop experience to make things easy for the users. Also instead of learning all the complex cloud native tools user can just setup an account on Mega Mesh and leave the rest to us. 

Keeping in mind automation and future support as well, Mega Mesh also provides API support as well for all the features available in platform.

### Service Mesh

In Mega Mesh, you can stitch together hybrid applications containing multiple microservices, serverless functions, managed services and APIs. 

Platform Mesh Designer provides:

1. For serverless, when you commit the code into the code repo, pulls the code, builds it, creates a transient container and execute on-demand.
2. Library of open source and commercially available microservices.

### Multiple Cloud Support

Mega Mesh supports different clouds and all the tools to make the process of deployment efficient and hassle free. It also provides support for multiple Kubernetes Cluster across multiple clouds.

### Service Flow Diagram

Mega Mesh interactive drag and drop UI provides service flow diagram. This decreases the process of understanding the whole flow of services deployment. 

Mega Mesh provide a flow diagram using which user can easily visualize whole process of what will happen with service mesh. Using this user can at once understand which components  are communicating with which other components and any issue arrived at any point can be taken care of in no time. Real time flow of services can also be be visualized. 

### Dashboard

Mega Mesh also provides detailed dashboards for different components of the platform. e.g. using Service dashboard, you can navigate and search your services and all the details related to the services like ports, variables etc. 

Similarly, platform provides dashboard for other modules as well. 

#### Health Dashboard

One of the dashboard that will be provided in platform is health dashboard. Health dashboard will provide detailed information like latency, error rate for a service. In this way you will be able to pinpoint the issue and focus on the health of specific service in a mesh. 

### Assessment & Evaluation

Users can also run tests on the new services or the new version of services before taking those services live into production. This can even be done without affecting the existing users. Using this feature, you can check the health and telemetry of services before going live. 

### Monitoring & Alerts

For timely monitoring and issue diagnosis, you can setup alerts as well in Mega Mesh. Alerts can be setup for monitoring of different mesh components like CPU, Memory, usage and latency.  Threshold can be set on which the platform which generate alerts. 

Alerts notifications can be configured using webhooks for different collaboration platforms like slack etc. 

Using monitoring and alerts, you can keep a timely check on the behavior and activity pattern of different components in a mesh. 

### Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

Keeping in mind the organization's need for privacy and proper access control, Mega Mesh also provides RBAC as well. 

Using RBAC, appropriate roles and permissions can be provided to the users based on their requirements and role inside the company. You can also share resources between Users and Group.  

There is also a feature of manual or role based request for a new role/group requirements

RBAC will also be integrated with AD.
