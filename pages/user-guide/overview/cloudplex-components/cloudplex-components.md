Some of the major cloud native tools integrated with Mega Mesh are - Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, Knative, Grafana, Prometheus, Kiali.

### Unified User Interface

Mega Mesh is basically a deployment platform using which you can manage, develop and deploy cloud native applications. It usually takes weeks or even months to understand and use different cloud native tools. 

Using Mega Mesh Unified UI, you can not only manage and configure different cloud native technologies like Istio, Knative etc at one place but also develop and deploy applications as well. Instead of learning all the complex cloud native tools user can just setup an account on Mega Mesh and leave the rest to us.
