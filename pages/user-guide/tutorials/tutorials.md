On Mega Mesh, either you can create and configure new cluster, network and solutions to deploy the project or use some of the pre built template for clusters, network to deploy the project.

Mega Mesh has simplified the process of deployment. Using pre built templates, user can save time configuring the clusters, networks or solutions every time to deploy the project. They can configure the solution once, save it as a template and use that for different projects. 

This section will explain how easy it is to create and store a template on platform and how to use some of the pre built templates to deploy the project.
