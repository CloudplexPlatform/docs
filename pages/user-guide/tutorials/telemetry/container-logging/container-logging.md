# Container Logging

Container Logging modules gives detailed logs for all the containers that are part of a mesh. Kibana is implemented for logs. 

User can also search for specific log using the search bar and can also retrieve logs using a snapshot. 

Mostly multiple containers will be part of a mesh, so user can also get the logs of any specific container using All Systems drop-down.
