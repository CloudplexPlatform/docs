# Examples

On Mega Mesh, either you can create and configure new cluster, network and solutions to deploy the project or use some of the pre built template for clusters, network to deploy the project.

Mega Mesh has simplified the process of deployment. Using pre built templates, user can save time configuring the clusters, networks or solutions every time to deploy the project. They can configure the solution once, save it as a template and use that for different projects. 

This section will explain how easy it is to use some of the pre built templates and deploy the project. 

This section will be further divided in to labs, to make it easy for beginners as well as experts develop their understanding of the platform in steps.

**Lab 1:** It will discuss the process of deployment using pre defined templates already stored in that platform.

**Lab 2:** It will discuss the process of deployment and how to create templates of Cluster, Network etc. to use in deployment.

**Lab 3:** It will discuss the process of deployment and in depth configurations of solution templates like use of dynamic variables that will be used after deployment. 

Now lets move to the step by step guide for different labs and create a project.
