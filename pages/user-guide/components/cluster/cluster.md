# Cluster

A cluster is a group of machines instances or nodes on which the services can be deployed. Currently on CloudPlex, clusters can be created on AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure, GCP (Google Cloud Platform), Digital Ocean and IBM cloud.

The level of the configurations that can be done for Cluster differ based on application type. On CloudPlex, you can either setup Provide Managed Kubernetes Cluster or User Managed Kubernetes Cluster. To know more about the different between the two, click [here](/pages/user-guide/components/application/application).
