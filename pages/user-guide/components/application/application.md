# Application

Application is where all the other modules cluster, network, kubernetes and apps will be configured together and the services will be deployed on the nodes. The purpose of the Application is to use the cluster, apps, network and deploy the microservices after detailed configuration. 

CloudPlex offers 3 ways of infrastructure creation and deployment on the cloud, based on the requirements of the user. 

1. Provider Managed
   To setup a cloud provider (AWS, Azure etc) managed Kubernetes cluster on CloudPlex.

   - Create New Kubernetes Cluster
     To create new provider managed Kubernetes cluster from scratch

   - Use Existing Kubernetes Cluster

     This option can be used for the following 2 use cases

     1. To manage and deploy apps on any existing provider managed kubernetes cluster using CloudPlex
     2. To migrate application from any existing kubernetes cluster to CloudPlex. User can then add new services to the application or migrate that to any other cloud.

2. User Managed
   To build whole infrastructure and Kubernetes from scratch using CloudPlex intuitive user interface.

   - Create New Kubernetes Cluster
     To setup a new infrastructure and kubernetes cluster from scratch.
   - Create New On-Premise Kubernetes Cluster
     To use On-Premise machines to create a Kubernetes cluster.

3. Clone Existing Application
   This feature is recommended when the users want to deploy an application having the same configurations or after making minute changes on any existing applications.

## Application Deletion

On CloudPlex, as part of application creation process user will need to configure Cluster, Network, and an Application. At any stage of the process, user can save the application template as **Draft**. Completed application template will have **New** status as shown in image below. 

Once the Application is in **New** state, user can then Deploy an application. CloudPlex keeps on updating application status during the deployment process for the user to understand better at which phase of the deployment an application is in. Application can have following statuses. 

1. Draft
2. New
3. Cluster Created
4. Cluster Teminated
5. Network Created
6. Network Terminated
7. App Deployed
8. Terminated

User can delete the application at any stage except the **App Deployed** by clicking the 3 dot icon on every application card. To delete App Deployed applications, user will first need to terminate those applications.  

> **Deleting** an Application won't terminate resources from Cloud, it will just deleted the data from CloudPlex. It is always recommended that user **Terminate** the application in CloudPlex to terminate all the resources on Cloud.
