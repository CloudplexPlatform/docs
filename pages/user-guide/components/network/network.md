# Networking

Networking deals with the configuration related to a network. Network is important for the connectivity of resources and sharing of information over the internet. In order to establish a connection among different nodes, a proper network configuration is required. Network configuration is necessary to detail the type of connection that will be established with the nodes. 

For details of the configurations that can be done at Network level for each cloud provider, please click the relevant link.

To create a Network using CloudPlex, it is necessary for the user cloud profile to have all the required permissions. For detailed guide on all the required permissions, click [here](/pages/user-guide/components/cloud-authorization-level/cloud-authorization-level).
