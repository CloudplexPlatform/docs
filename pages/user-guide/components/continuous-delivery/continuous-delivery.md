# Continuous Delivery

A development practice where changes in the code are prepared automatically for production release. By deploying all the code changes to a testing or production environment after the build stage, continuous delivery is like an extension of continuous integration. Continuous delivery if implemented properly, will make process of deployment hassle free as developers will have deployment ready build that has already been passed through a standardized test process. 

Using continuous delivery, every code change is built, tested, and pushed to a testing or staging environment. This results in multiple and parallel test stages before a final production deployment. 

Continuous delivery helps developers in automating the testing process by going beyond unit tests so that applications can be verified before deploying to customers. Testing may include integration testing, load testing, UI testing etc. Using this, developers can thoroughly and easily validate updates and discover the issues beforehand. This will make sure that new changes will be released to the customers in a quicker and sustainable way. Clouds have further made it easy to efficiently and effectively automate the process of creation and replication of multiple environments for testing etc. 

Some of the benefits of continuous delivery are. 

1. Automation the Process of Software Releases.
2. Improves Productivity of Developers
3. Quick Discovery and Resolution of Bugs
4. Frequent and Faster Updates
