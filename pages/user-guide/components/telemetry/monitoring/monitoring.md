# Monitoring

Metrics provides a way to monitor and understand the behavior of an app in aggregate.

To monitor the behavior of services in depth, metrics for all service traffic in, out and within the app is generated. These metrics gives complete information of service behavior like error rates within the traffic, volume of traffic, response times for requests etc. 

In addition to helping in understanding the behavior of services with the app, these metrics also helps in monitoring the behavior of the app itself. Users can then get an insight on the health and function of app control panel.

Metrics used for monitoring can also be customized. Metrics collection depends on the way they are configured. User can select how and when the metrics should be collected and level of details it should contain. This enables user to fine tune the process of metrics collection based on their application requirements.
