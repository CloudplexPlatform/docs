# Config Maps

Allow to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable. ConfigMap stores configuration data as key-value pairs. The data can be consumed in pods or provide the configurations for system components such as controllers. ConfigMap is similar to Secrets, but provides a means of working with strings that donâ€™t contain sensitive information. Users and system components alike can store configuration data in ConfigMap.

Details of the configurations that can be done for Config Maps are explained below and also highlighted in the image.
