# Access Management

Ultramesh access management as the name suggests is a module developed to manage the access levels on platform. It deals with Ultramesh Role Based Access Control (RBAC). The function of RBAC is to give appropriate level of permissions to different users of a company based on requirements. 

Access management was developed keeping in mind the requirements of enterprises. As there are different teams working on the same project but each team need access of only the features or modules required to carry out their tasks. 

Using access management, teams can be created in platform. Users within a team can be given member access or lead access. This makes sure that within every team there is a lead assigning access of only the relevant resources to each team member. 

RBAC is deeply integrated with the platform. After the creation of every resource, i.e. cluster, network, solution etc, user will be able to give permissions based on teams. This will make sure that only the teams working on those resources are getting the access. 

Companies that value security try to give only the optimum level of permissions or access to different users to maintain the efficiency by giving only the required level of access. This features is also beneficial as by giving appropriate level of access to the users, the company can only expose limited part of the platform to different users which will secure their account or system from unauthorized access. This can also help in segregation of duties within the team by granting access to only those features needed for the job. 

Ultramesh RBAC consists of **Roles**, **Teams**, and **User**

**Roles:** A Role can be defined as a set of permissions for different modules or resources on the platform e.g. View, Create, Delete permission of Clusters. 

**Team:** A Team is simply a collection of Users and Roles they have been assigned.  A Role can be assigned to one or more Teams and one Team can have multiple roles for different Users. e.g. you can create one Role for full access of Cluster and other Role for full access of Network. You can then assign those two Roles to different Users within the team based on the access level they will be needing to complete their tasks. 

**Users:** On Ultramesh, access is provided to the users based on the Teams they are part of. Users can be assigned Teams depending upon their responsibilities. Users that have been given any kind of access and are part of a team will appear here. 

There is also a feature of manual or role based request for a new role/group requirements

> **Note:** Access Management menu will only be available to the Team Lead user of the platform. 

> **Note:** RBAC will also be integrated with Active Directory (AD). Users can be assigned relevant roles and fetched from AD.

Now, letâ€™s move to the step by step guide on how to use Access Management.

## Users

## Roles

Next step is to create roles that will be later assigned to team members. Platform provides some prebuilt roles for Team Leads and Team Players but you can also create custom roles as well. 

First time user registering from the company domain will be assigned Team Lead role. All the other users from that domain will be assigned Team Player role by default but you can change the role assigned to the user.

To create a new Role:

1. Go to the **Roles** tab.

   Prebuilt roles are also listed here - Admin, Team Lead, Team Player.
