# Access Management

Keeping in mind the organization's need for privacy and proper access control, Mega Mesh also provides Access Management (RBAC) as well. 

Access Management deals with the MegaMesh Role Based Access Control (RBAC) feature. The function of RBAC is to give appropriate level of permissions to the users of a company to maintain the effectiveness of operations and efficiency of employees.

Companies that value security try to give only the optimum level of permissions or access to different users to maintain the efficiency by giving only the required level of access. This features is also beneficial as by giving appropriate level of access to the users, the company can only expose limited part of the platform to different users which will secure their account or system from unauthorized access. This can also help in segregation of duties within the team by granting access to only those features needed for the job. 

MegaMesh RBAC consists of **Roles**, **Teams**, and **User**

**Roles:** A Role can be defined as a set of permissions for different modules or resources on the platform e.g. View, Create, Delete permission of Clusters. 

**Team:** A Team is simply a collection of Users and Roles they have been assigned.  A Role can be assigned to one or more Teams and one Team can have multiple roles for different Users. e.g. you can create one Role for full access of Cluster and other Role for full access of Network. You can then assign those two Roles to different Users within the team based on the access level they will be needing to complete their tasks. 

**Users:** On MegaMesh, access is provided to the users based on the Teams they are part of. Users can be assigned Teams depending upon their responsibilities. Users that have been given any kind of access and are part of a team will appear here. 

There is also a feature of manual or role based request for a new role/group requirements

> **Note:** Access Management menu will only be available to the Team Lead user of the platform. 

> **Note:** RBAC will also be integrated with Active Directory (AD). Users can be assigned relevant roles and fetched from AD.

Now, letâ€™s move to the step by step guide on how to use Access Management.

## Users

## Roles

Next step is to create roles that will be later assigned to team members. Platform provides some prebuilt roles for Team Leads and Team Players but you can also create custom roles as well. 

First time user registering from the company domain will be assigned Team Lead role. All the other users from that domain will be assigned Team Player role by default but you can change the role assigned to the user.

To create a new Role:

1. Go to the **Roles** tab.

   Prebuilt roles are also listed here - Admin, Team Lead, Team Player.
