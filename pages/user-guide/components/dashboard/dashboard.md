# Dashboard

Ultramesh also provides detailed dashboards for understanding the current state of your platform. Gaining insight into the status of your mesh, including your application health, as well as debugging your application, is an integral part of deploying a production application. We've designed a set of dashboards that will let you feel confident your enterprise software is running properly and get answers fast when it's not. 

## Health Dashboard

On the health dashboard, you can see key indicators of application health. For each service you've deployed on Ultramesh, you can view latency, error rate, and monitor key performance indicators. 


## Debugging Dashboard

In the debugging dashboard, you can quickly get information on any services that have elevated error rates. Debugging mesh services can be complicated, so we've offered a view that makes it simple to understand which services are experiencing issues, and what those issues are. View current status and any error indicators from any service deployed on Ultramesh.
