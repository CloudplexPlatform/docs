# Serverless

Serverless framework helps developers build serverless applications with less cost and overheads. It provides a powerful and unified experience to develop, deploy and test serverless applications. It basically takes care of the end to end process of application development. 

Serverless applications can be developed and tested on different cloud providers like AWS, Azure etc. These applications can then also be secured and monitored. 

MegaMesh has made to it easy deploy serverless applications. Not only deployment, MegaMesh also takes care of the creation process of serverless applications. These serverless applications can also be a part of ultra mesh that can contain services of different types like containers, managed services etc. By making all these different service types a part of single project on MegaMesh, we are making it easier for the user to develop and deploy complex applications using easy to use drag-n-drop interface of platform.
